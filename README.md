# web-crawler

Introduction
This software is produced to crawl a website and extracting the text data from it on python.

Requirement
This works better with python 3.7.

How to use
1) Install the package using command pip install .
2) Once installed you can use it by calling the function begin_crawling().
3) The function takes 2 parameters:
    i) Url to be crawled as string.
    ii) Path of the directory where the crawled data is needed to be stored.

Warning
Using some websites for crawling might block your I.P address for that particular website for some time. Though delays can be introduced to eliminate the problem.

A TODO is specified in the source code(crawlerMain.py) which might require some attention based the website being used for crawling.
